### 👋 Hi, I'm Jimmy

I help teams solve their biggest business problems by designing and building machine learning systems. Currently, I'm a Data Science Lead at Whitbread (Premier Inn hotels). Outside of work:

- 🌱 I'm learning: NLP (deep learning), Azure Machine Learning (DP-100)
- 📝 I'm reading: data science newsletters/blogs/twitter/books, classic literature (Albert Camus currently)
- 😅 I'm staying fit: football, yoga, weight training
