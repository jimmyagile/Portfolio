# Jimmy Edgell
### 👋 Hi, I'm Jimmy

I help teams to solve their biggest business problems, and enjoy dedicating myself to (responsibly) developing, deploying & iterating on ML systems. Currently I'm working as a Data Science Lead at Whitbread (Premier Inn hotels). Outside of work:

- 🌱 I'm learning: NLP (deep learning), whilst pursuing the DeepLearning.ai Specialization in MLOps
- 📚 I'm reading: Albert Camus' The Plague, and tuning in on Physics/Neuroscience/History audiobooks
- 😅 I'm keeping fit: playing football, hiking, lifting weights, practicing yoga
- 🎶 I'm jamming: music discovery, seeking out techy guitar riffs
