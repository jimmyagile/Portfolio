### 👋 Hi, I'm Jimmy

I help teams solve their biggest business problems by designing and building machine learning systems. Currently, I'm a Data Science Lead at Whitbread (Premier Inn hotels). Outside of work:

- 🌱 I'm learning: NLP (deep learning), MLOps (pursuing the DeepLearning.ai Specialization in Machine Learning Engineering for Production) 
- 📝 I'm reading: classic literature (Albert Camus The Plague currently), amongst the daily feed of data science twitter/newsletters/blogs
- 😅 I'm staying fit: weight lifting, football, yoga (a handstand press-up is the goal!)
