# Jimmy Edgell
### 👋 Hi, I'm Jimmy

I help teams solve their biggest business problems by designing and building machine learning systems. Currently, I'm a Data Science Lead at Whitbread (Premier Inn hotels). Outside of work:

- 🌱 I'm learning: NLP (deep learning), whilst pursuing the MLOps DeepLearning.ai Specialization (Machine Learning Engineering for Production) 
- 📚 I'm reading: classic literature (Albert Camus' The Plague currently), as well as consuming popular science and history audiobooks on my travels
- 😅 I'm keeping fit: playing football, hiking, lifting weights, yoga (a handstand press-up is the goal)
- 🎶 I'm listening: music discovery, seeking out inspiring riffs (to avoid the guitar becoming a dusty ornament)
