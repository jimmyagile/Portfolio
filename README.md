# Jimmy Edgell
### 👋 Hi, I'm Jimmy

I'm a Data Scientist specialising in unlocking the value of customer data and applied NLP. I enjoy dedicating myself to (responsibly) developing, deploying & iterating on ML systems. Currently, I'm working as a Senior Data Scientist in the travel sector with WestJet. Outside of work:

- 🌱 I'm learning: Pursuing the DeepLearning.ai MLOps Specialization, tuning in to Physics/Neuroscience/History audiobooks
- 🏋️ I'm keeping fit: snowboarding & hiking British Columbia, lifting weights, practicing yoga
- 🎶 I'm sound seeking: music discovery, gig-going, occasional guitar-ing
